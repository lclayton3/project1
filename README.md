Lauren Clayton
Project 1

Overview:

In this project I have implemented a linked list in C. The structures for this list are defined by two structs, a list struct and a node struct. The functions defined in this file are create_list(), add_to_list(), remove_from_list(), print_list(), flush_list(), and free_list(). Since malloc() is utilized in this program, it was my responsibilty to free the memory that was allocated fro both the list and each node that was created.
